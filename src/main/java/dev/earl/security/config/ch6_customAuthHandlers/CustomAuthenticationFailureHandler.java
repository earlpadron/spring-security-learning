/**
 * CH 6.23
 *
 * There are situations in practical scenarios when a client expects a certain
 * format of the response in case of failed authentication. They may expect a
 * different HTTP status code than 401 Unauthorized or additional information
 * in the body of the response. The most typical case I have found in
 * applications is to send a "charitalics"request identifier. This request identifier
 * has a unique value used to trace back the request among multiple systems,
 * and the application can send it in the body of the response in case of failed
 * authentication. Another situation is when you want to sanitize the response to
 * make sure that the application doesnâ€™t expose sensitive data outside of the
 * system. You might want to define custom logic for failed authentication
 * simply by logging the event for further investigation
